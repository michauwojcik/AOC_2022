##### My solutions grouped by days. 
---

Tasks can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).



### Running code
Code for each day can be run from repo's root directory  with command: `python <directory> [ARGS]`.

```bash
$ python Day_1st/ --help
usage: [-h] [--filepath FILEPATH]

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --filepath FILEPATH  a relative path to filename with inventory


```
